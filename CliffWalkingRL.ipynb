    "The task is simply to reach the point G by starting from point S in the map. However, there is a cliff we should avoid so that -100 reward incurs if a transition into the cliff is made. We will use two approaches to solve the problem as it can be seen from the picture. If we use **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)** the agent will choose the safer path above. On the other side if we use **Q-Learning** the agent will choose relatively more dangerous but closer path. Note that these two methods are versions of **Temporal Difference** methods since they update the value function at each _time step_, not at each _episode_. Let's start with global methods."

Different rewards will result in different solutions so that **reward function implementation is one of the most important concepts in RL**. For this application the cliffs incurs -100 and other transitions incur -1. Also note that, generally rewards are implemented via a state-action matrix.

İn terms of average reward at the end of the training, since SARSA cares safety its average is greater than Q-Learning."
